            <p>With that being said…</p>

            <p>There’s one thing that can sabotage your immune system and put you at risk of future toenail fungal infections.</p>

            <P>It plays a key role in healing the body while it naturally guards against foreign substances like infections, injuries, toxins, and diseases.</P>

            <p>Curcumin, which is a molecular component of turmeric, is its most active, health-boosting and inflammation squashing compound.</p>

            <p>Curcumin is more effective for soothing out of control inflammation than just about anything out there.</p>

            <p>In fact, if Big Pharma came up with a drug that could do everything turmeric can do, it’d be considered one of the biggest breakthroughs of the century.</p>

            <p>Companies would be racing to put patents on it so they could rake in billions of dollars in profits.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have shown that turmeric may potentially help treat Candida overgrowth and various other types of fungal and yeast infections too.</p>
            <p>One study proved that curcumin possessed antifungal activity against 14 different strains of Candida.<sup>1</sup></p>

            <p>Which means, very often when you take turmeric as a supplement you end up wasting over 90% of what’s in the capsule.</p>
            <p>And that’s NOT good.</p>
            <p>Not only is it a waste of money, but you’ll never get all the anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal benefits that turmeric has to offer.</p>
            <p>To make matters worse some turmeric brands have been shown to contain dangerous amounts of additives like lead.</p>
